            <h3>Why Should I Look </h3>
            <p>    So if you are reading this tutorial, you are probably thinking to yourself "I want a better quality of life and more money"
               Well, at least that's how it was for me though. If the nice quality of life doesn't attract you, another great motivational factor is money.
               The average software Developer starting pay with 0 Years of experience as of 2019, is 45K. From my experience though, in this field the harder you work at your craft, 
               the greater you will get paid. I myself got offered 80k as my very first job after a small couple month internship of $21 an hour. I also know of 2 people who were very young
               with no college degrees, who started their first job over 100k and unlimited paid time off!</p>

            <p>If you are still interested in this field, lets talk about what exactly is the I.T field.
               So you probably have heard of some people classifying all tech jobs as "I.T", and this is somewhat accurate.
               Information technology is an umbrella term for a plethora of jobs, all with a common union, which is revolving around computers.
               Many major companies have I.T departments which consist of thousands of specialists. To name a few major ones there are that you 
               could join once you know how to code, (Web Development, Application Development, System Tools, Database Administrator, Data Scientist,
               Video Game Developers, Ethical Hackers, Cyber Security, Software Engineering, Front End Developer, Back End Developer, Full Stack Developer), and there are many many more jobs as this 
               field is forever expanding as humanity is expanding the digital age we are currently in. Some jobs use more code than others, while some other jobs use the fancy computer terminal.
            </p>

            <p>So from a road map perspective, this first tutorial is going to cover the journey of everything you need to know to become a full stack web developer. Keep in mind that it takes a LONG time to fully
                master this field, and it should not be expected from you to have learned and mastered everything. The key to this field is becoming a master of knowing where to look for the information, so exposure is key.
                One extremely useful method of success is to write alot of notes of where to find stuff and what it is. In this field, it's very important that you set your pride aside, in order to learn, which means ask questions.
